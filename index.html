            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <div class="about-me">
                <p>
                    My name is Samuel Jacobs! I'm a freshman studying cybersecurity at BYU. 
                    I love to read, hike, play the piano, and watch football! But most of all, I'm excited to be here at BYU and learn about cybersecurity!
                    I was born in Bellevue, Washington in 2003 and moved to Utah when I was 3 years old. 
                    I grew up in a city called Layton, and graduated from Northridge High in 2021. 
                    I served a 2 year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Uruguay Montevideo West Mission.

            <h2>My BYU Experience</h2>
            <div class="byu-experience">
                <p>It has been my dream my entire life to attend BYU. As a kid, it was mostly because I wanted to go to every football game. I remember the first time I stepped foot on
                campus as a kid, and I felt a connection then that assured me that this place would one day be my home.</p>
                <p>My first semester here has been incredible. I have loved my classes, the people I've met, the activities around campus, and most of all, the focus on Christ-centered
                learning.</p>
                <p>I have learned technical skills and abilities in my programming and cybersecurity classes, I have learned about American political thought, economics, and philosophy
                from my American Heritage class, I have learned to appreciate more deeply the power of the Book of Mormon in my religion class, and I have learned about all the
                amazing resources and advantages of a BYU education from Univ 101.</p>

            <h2>Future Plans!</h2>
            <div class="future-plans">
                <p>I'm so excited to pursue lifelong service through a career in cybersecurity. I love the idea of using my passions to help improve and protect the lives of others.
                    I'm also excited to continue to live by the values I've learned here at BYU. I know that by centering my life around Jesus Christ and His restored gospel, I 
                    can prepare to raise a family, serve God, and be a light to others. I'm so grateful for the opportunity to study here at BYU and make that dream a reality.</p>
